# STRIDE-TRIM Threat modeling generator

The yaml generator for threat assessment according to STRIDE-TRIM. 

Each assessment result in a sigle file and should be limited in scope. Typical cope limitations include:
* A single activity, or task related to a solution
* A single part of a solution
* A limited set of an architecture

It is helpful to have an image representing the solution and its threat boundaries, such as a simple architecture drawing.

This generator works in accordance to Adam Shostack [EoP card deck](https://github.com/adamshostack/eop), with the addition of the TRIM rules based on F-secure [Elevation of Privacy](https://github.com/F-Secure/elevation-of-privacy).
